4.1 change log:
Summarry:
    Changed the flow process from file type dependent to structure dependent flow, changing the complicated process to a more simplier one.
    
Detailed Summarry:
    Options:
        Removed File type options in favor of a general default settings that would be stored with the application.
        
    Job Selection:
        Instead of choosing from the actual jobs, the choices are now pulled from the defaults. This would add more flexibility.
        Side Note: The job you choose is irrelevant to what you want to generate as it only contains default data that
            the application will use.
        
    Transmittal Selection:
        You are now to browse and select the folder(ex. 1161_TRANS#001_SECTOR F_IFA_08-08-16) where the transmittal folder 
        is located instead of choosing from the dropdown box.
        
    Transmittal Calculation Process:
        Only the reading of files have been changed. Instead of having a file type tied to a description, the description 
        is now pulled from the name of the folder(ex. Erection--this is a folder that contains all erection drawings
        and will be the description of the files within it). The files that is directly inside the transmittal folder and
        does not have a folder of it's own will not be read.
        
        Structure sample:
            1161_TRANS#001_SECTOR F_IFA_08-08-16
                            |
                            |__Erection
                            |         |
                            |         |__(Erection files)... - - Will be read
                            |          
                            |__Shop Drawings
                            |         |
                            |         |__(Shop Drawing Files)... - - Will be read
                            |          
                            |__(other files that is not in a folder) - - THIS WILL NOT BE READ
